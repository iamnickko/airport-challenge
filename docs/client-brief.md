# Client Brief

### Value Proposition
This is software that provides insight into the current capacity of the airport and the currently grounded planes so that Air Traffic Controllers can efficiently control the flow of planes without risk of overcrowding.

---
### Core Features
- Airport capacity is defined and can be edited on the fly as required.
- Allows Air Traffic Controllers to:
  - instruct planes to land if the airport is not full and the plane is not already at the airport.
  - instruct a plane to take off from an airport as long as it is currently at the airport.

### Benefits
- Having visibility on the capacity of the airport allows Air Traffic Controllers to not overcrowd the airport with more planes once airport capacity has been reached, whilst maximising flow efficiency with an accurate 'one in, one out' method if desired.
- Being able to edit the capacity of the airport on the fly will allow flexibility in the system to increase or decrease the flow of planes in and out of the airport when necessary.

### Risks
- Upon implementation, it may be apparent that a particular feature has been missed from the initial requirements and therefore may hinder your operational efficiency.
- By adopting new software, there may be a period of inefficiency due to lack of staff training. This will be alleviated as user familiarity increases.
